## A Preamble / Hopeful Conclusion

To the CEO and the boards, while this is your decision to make, I'd like to emphasize my feeling that it is not your fault.

For those whose fault this is, wherever they may exist within your org charts, they executed poorly based on two possible opportunities which are no longer present.

One opportunity was to make a reality show around my family and I; however this would involve me providing my consent, and I will do no such thing for no price whatsoever: the opportunity to make a TV show is not happening.

The other opportunity was around coordinating a legal issue which has since ended at least a week and a half ago, and the business development opportunities such a coordination could provide to Comcast and it's organizations given the "A-Z list" of celebrities whom took an interest in the issue. However, given the rocky road the legal issue took, along with my own interjections, it's dubious at best to say the business development opportunities still exist in full, and among those that do, allowing this situation to continue is not helping as it casts doubts on the efficacy of those engaging in the situation for business development purposes.

There is only one thing that continuing this situation is allowing: an attempt for those who have failed you, whose fault this is, to save some face, which they will not be able to do, because the continuation of this situation will only force me to speak outwardly about it, which is damaging to them, but unfortunately also to the organizations whom trusted them.

Think: a week ago, many knew the legal situation had ended, but I wasn't saying anything - many likely presumed that was a good sign as towards this situation ending the harm it has caused, and most looked well on this. Now those that would look well on this ending it's harm cannot do so as they are aware the situation, and thus the harm it causes, persists.

So I'd ask you this: given that this situation bears no opportunity to make a product or aide in business expansion, is it worth it to let those whose fault it is attempt to save their own reputation at the cost of the company given the negative internal media PR and damage control that has already cost so much in expensive labor hours that could have gone to areas of the business that actually make products or lasting strategic connections, all while this effort is making no product and only challenging the strength of strategic connections by forcing others to question the purpose, trustfullness, and efficacy of those they partner with? Is this still good for the _business_?

Currently those under you are trying and failing to convince me the legal issue continues, likely to buy time to figure out what to _actually_ do to end this situation in their favor, which is a pipe dream at this point considering all that has and hasn't happened.
 
Given there's no product or strategic connection to be maintained in this situation, is it worth the cost of continuing it?

Woudln't it be easier to control the story as a positive tool for business communications - who doesn't love a good story? - without me having a need to write further into it? Wouldn't that be easier if the story ended? It would for me. And I think it would be easiest for the board to deal with this before and not after Q4 meetings wrap up.

Thank you for your time; more to come here as and if needed.
