## A Preamble / Hopeful Conclusion

To the CEO and the boards, while this is your decision to make, I'd like to emphasize my feeling that it is not your fault.

For those whose fault this is, wherever they may exist within your org charts, they executed poorly based on two possible opportunities which are no longer present.

One opportunity was to make a reality show around my family and I; however this would involve me providing my consent, and I will do no such thing for no price whatsoever: the opportunity to make a TV show is not happening.

The other opportunity was around coordinating a legal issue which has since ended at least a week and a half ago, and the business development opportunities such a coordination could provide to Comcast and it's organizations given the "A-Z list" of celebrities whom took an interest in the issue. However, given the rocky road the legal issue took, along with my own interjections, it's dubious at best to say the business development opportunities still exist in full, and among those that do, allowing this situation to continue is not helping as it casts doubts on the efficacy of those engaging in the situation for business development purposes.

There is only one thing that continuing this situation is allowing: an attempt for those who have failed you, whose fault this is, to save some face, which they will not be able to do, because the continuation of this situation will only force me to speak outwardly about it, which is damaging to them, but unfortunately also to the organizations whom trusted them.

Think: a week ago, many knew the legal situation had ended, but I wasn't saying anything - many likely presumed that was a good sign as towards this situation ending the harm it has caused, and most looked well on this. Now those that would look well on this ending it's harm cannot do so as they are aware the situation, and thus the harm it causes, persists.

So I'd ask you this: given that this situation bears no opportunity to make a product or aide in business expansion, is it worth it to let those whose fault it is attempt to save their own reputation at the cost of the company given the negative internal media PR and damage control that has already cost so much in expensive labor hours that could have gone to areas of the business that actually make products or lasting strategic connections, all while this effort is making no product and only challenging the strength of strategic connections by forcing others to question the purpose, trustfullness, and efficacy of those they partner with? Is this still good for the _business_?

Currently those under you are trying and failing to convince me the legal issue continues, likely to buy time to figure out what to _actually_ do to end this situation in their favor, which is a pipe dream at this point considering all that has and hasn't happened.
 
Given there's no product or strategic connection to be maintained in this situation, is it worth the cost of continuing it?

Woudln't it be easier to control the story as a positive tool for business communications - who doesn't love a good story? - without me having a need to write further into it? Wouldn't that be easier if the story ended? It would for me. And I think it would be easiest for the board to deal with this before and not after Q4 meetings wrap up.

Thank you for your time; more to come here as and if needed.

## The Central Legal Challenge

To the legal officials representing Comcast, I'd like to again reiterate that though this may be your responsibility, it is not necessarily your fault.

Many illegal and legally gray offenses were committed against my name and with no consent or contracts signed to allow this from myself over the course of the past two plus years that were either conducted within the organizations under Comcast, or with collusion by Comcast representatives.

The worst of the offenses may be colluding to commit, coordinate, and conceal criminal medical malpractice, in an affront to medical ethics established via the Tuskegee Experiments, the Nuremberg Trials, and more. Other offenses would fall under the filming and livestreaming of myself to audiences without and against my consent.

Those allowing these acts to take place under Comcast's ownership felt that all legal claims would be suppressed after and not before the fact by my signing a contract to agree to a reality television show, and acted with brazen criminality as a result: for this, they were greatly mistaken. I will never, ever sign a contract withdrawing legal claims and allowing harm to be conducted against me in exchange for a reality television show I never agreed to be a part of and would never agree to. I do not wish to be famous.

Comcast could choose to simply walk away from the situation and deny it ever happened, but that would create a negative atmosphere amongst the media in many forms detrimental to Comcast's overall goals as a media organization. The largest complication is that all of this occured with most of the media watching via the non consensual filming of me being live streamed by Comcast representatives, where many were under the assumption that such an act was sympathethic and agreeable to me: it was and is not.

Within the media, many on the creative side took it as a rubric of inspiration and created popular media products in light of it, including some of the most popular products of the past two years, and Comcast's business goals here were largely in aligning positively with these creatives. Many of these creatives would like _and were expecting_ to see a conclusion where all parties are left better off, such to avoid feeling negatively about the situation they participated in at Comcast's behest. This would be best for Comcast as a media company with future interests in working with creatives of all kinds in contracts of mutual benefit.

Furthermore, in the future exposure of this event could be to political or economic advantage to numerous parties, companies, and labor unions, so a conclusion that can be publicly claimed and agreed to by all parties involved, including myself, is the best course for the future should any conversation, public or private, arise.

Finally, it is my assumption that under your watch a certain amount of information must be gathered as to what happened, in both the near and long term. It is my guidance that those involved had very little to be proud of, and will all in different parts try and not tell a full story in order to be perceived in a better light than the truth. **Given this, I would strongly recommend seeking an outside investigator without any biases to Comcast or it's child organizations such to avoid issues of cognitive bias in seeking out all the details of what happened.**

All that said, I do wish to put this whole situation behind me, **as soon as possible**, and am more negotiable than not.
